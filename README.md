# LAC Slack Invite Automation
------------
This branch will feed the Heroku app controlling my church's Slack team invites. It's forked from [Outsider](https://github.com/outsideris)'s [Slack invite automator](https://github.com/outsideris/slack-invite-automation), a great and easy tool for setting up automatic invites for a large team. Outsider's full README and installation instructions are on the master branch of this repo, as well as on his original repo.

The tool is mostly unchanged except for a few styling changes to match the church.
